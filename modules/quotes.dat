“As you come into this world, something else is also born. 
You begin your life, and it begins a journey towards you. 
It moves slowly, but it never stops. 
Wherever you go, whatever path you take, it will follow. 
Never faster, never slower. Always coming. 
You will run, it will walk. 
You will rest, it will not. 
One day, you will linger in the same place too long. 
You will sit too still or sleep too deep. 
And when, too late, you rise to go, you will notice a second shadow next to yours. 
Your life will then be over.”

“In 1977 a probe was launched into space called "Voyager One", 41 years later "Voyager One" is travelling away from us at about 38,000 miles an hour and is now thirteen billion miles distant, 
and aboard Voyager is a message from Jimmy Carter the 39th president of the United States and the message reads: 

    "This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts and our feelings. 
    We are attempting to survive our time, so we may live into yours we hope someday, having solved the problems we've faced, to join a community of galactic civilizations. 
    This record represents our hope, and our determination, and our good will in a vast and awesome universe."

    And were we able to include just a few more lines in that message to tell our spacey friends a little more about ourselves
    and our deep history, and our ambitions, and our ancestors just maybe we'd say that:
        Well P.S. We think shit went down like this… Life probably began on our planet about four billion years ago, as simple organic machines —we don't know how yet— 
        then a sudden explosion of diversity five hundred million years ago, fifty million more years and plants are taking the land over, fifty million more and insects have arrived,
        next the dinosaurs are taking the stage —700 species *at least*— ruling the planet for around a hundred and fourty five million years before something —possibly asteroid shaped— wipes them out,
        but it's okay because here come bats and butterflies, giraffes, bears, hyenas, sloths, vultures, mammoths, TURTLES! 
        You fucking name it and then the rise of the primates and two million years ago appear our first true ancestor: 
        Homo Habilis, and at least fifteen other species of the Homo Species spreading out across the world until about 200,000 years ago when a new Specie, our Specie, emerges.
        Homo Sapiens Large brained, organizers, talkers, thinkers capable of high abstraction of building tribes, and cities, and nation states. 
        Capable of ending the world in a day, we have stepped into an age of great technological potency though there are gaping holes in our wisdom. 
        We have become a global superorganism though we still harbour our tribal inclinations. We've pulled a bunch of fuckups and we're really quite confused and alone and frankly scared. 
        But we hope to enjoy the privilege of being a semicolon in history rather than a full stop. 
        So on behalf of the hundred and fifty billion who came before us and our human cousins who didn't make it, 
        we just hope this message finds you well, and we hope when you find us thousands of years from now that we are well too. 
        In any case please just write back. It's dark out here. And we're the last humans left.”

“There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,
The earth, and every common sight,
To me did seem
Apparelled in celestial light,
The glory and the freshness of a dream.
It is not now as it hath been of yore;
Turn wheresoe'er I may,
By night or day.
The things which I have seen I now can see no more.”

“This part is very clear. 
You're nothing but a pawn, 
and you remain a pawn until you play.
The rules are clear, 
take what they give you, 
give away what you have to, 
and the difference is yours.
The question is... how big is the difference?”

“Sure, there are grays... 
But when you come right down to it, at its core, beneath every choice, there's either a one or a zero. You either do something or you don't. 
You walk out that door, you've decided to do nothing, to say no, which means you do not come back. 
You leave, you are no longer a part of this. You become a zero. 
If you stay, if you want to change the world, you become a yes. You become a one. 
So, I'll ask you again: are you a one or a zero?”

“Good Morning!" said Bilbo, and he meant it. 
The sun was shining, and the grass was very green. 
But Gandalf looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat.

"What do you mean?" he said. 
"Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want it or not; 
or that you feel good this morning; or that it is a morning to be good on?"

"All of them at once," said Bilbo. "And a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors, into the bargain.

...

"Good morning!" he said at last.
"We don't want any adventures here, thank you! You might try over The Hill or across The Water." By this he meant that the conversation was at an end.
"What a lot of things you do use Good morning for!" said Gandalf. "Now you mean that you want to get rid of me, and that it won't be good till I move off.”
